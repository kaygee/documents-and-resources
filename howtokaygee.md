# How to Kaygee

Hi, welcome to my manual!

## My style

- I like to get things done.
- I like tools and workflows that help me get work done.
- I enjoy crossing finish lines. Whether that's in delivering software, or racing bicycles/running/triathlon.
- Typically, I'm "alright" being alone for long periods of time. However, I enjoy interacting with people.
- I've been accussed of not being assertive enough.
  - This isn't because I don't have an opinion.
  - This isn't because I don't care.
  - I like to gather evidence and opinions and consider outcomes.
  - I'm interested in continuous improvement. It's likely I'll try anything once to try and get improvement.
  - I'm interested in gathering experience, so it's likely I'll try anything.
  - I'm more interested in succeeding as a group, so if it seems like the needs of the many will be met I'll try it.
- I take active breaks.
- There are many times that I'll come up with a solution to a problem while taking an "active break".
- I love lists.
- I tend to assume everyone is on the "same level" as I am.
- I like to keep a list of everything I do on a daily basis.
- Did I mention that I like lists? ;) I make checklists and organize my thoughts and collect information this way.
- I enjoy technology and applying it to my work. Especially, when it allows me to do things faster or not repeat myself.
- Sometimes I get in the zone after hours and commit code. I don't expect you to do this.
- I like getting feedback and enjoy talking about possibilities.
- I'm sarcastic and enjoy finding oddities in code/technology/etc... sometimes it might seem like I'm pessimistic about our ability to succeed.
- After I create something I usually "hate" it after a couple days.
  - I almost always feel compelled to refactor.
  - I believe that small incremental changes can add up to positive results.
- I like to think that we're releasing tested and working softwarer to our users and customers.

## What I value "at work"

- Feeling that I've provided you with something valuable.
- Helping you get things done.
- That I've given you the tools to help yourself now and in the future.
- Being asked questions.
- Being proud of what I've done, but being willing to tear it all down.
- Being able to trust you.
- Knowing what you're interested in for tools, processes, and goals for the yourself.

## What I don't have patience for

- Over-promising and under-delivering.
  - I always try and under-promise and over-deliver.
- Taking a task and not getting it done within a reasonable amount of time.
  - Not asking for help or suffering too long.
  - Not being transparent about difficulties.
- Not participating in the team discussion forums.
- If typing more than five sentences... it's probably worth a video call.

## How to best communicate with me

- Slack. I might send stuff on weekends/off-hours, but I don't expect you to respond until normal business hours.

## How to help me

- Let me know how you're doing and what you need.
- Send me "big ideas" you have.

## What people misunderstand about me

- When I have big ideas I might not have all the details, so I'll make a list with bits and pieces hoping to eventually generalize an idea or direction from them.
- I've worked in technology for quite a while and I know that technology is imperfect. I take joy in finding oddities and like to joke about the inevitability of failure. I also like to joke about the expectations of business from engineering.
- I don't like the term "quality assurance" because I think it implies that a gate has been passed through and after that gate quality has been assurred. I prefer the term "tester" because that's what I'm doing.

## What I value "outside of work"

- I like being outside experiencing nature.
  - Usually, this means "human powered transport", like running, cycling, kayaking, etc...
- I'm a family guy and I enjoy spending time with my wife and kids.
- I believe in that in order to have a healthy mind you need a healthy body.
- I try to do things that are outside of my comfort zone.
  - This might include ultra-marathon trail runs or changing the air-conditioning compressor on my car.
